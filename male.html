         <p>Zeus son of Kronos and Rhea, is the God of the Sky and King of the Gods of Mount Olympus.</p> <br>
         <p>When he was born his father planned to swallow him as he did his other children.</p> <br>
         <p>However Rhea hid newborn baby Zeus and gave Kronos a rock diguised as the baby to swallow.</p> <br>
         <p>When he was old enough he caused Kronos to vomit up his siblings and they vanquished their father.</p> <br>
         <p>He then split up creation with his brothers.</p> <br>
         <p>He claimed the sky and became King of Gods and Mount Olympus.</p> <br>
         <p>He is represented by symbols such as the Lightning bolt and the Eagle.</p> <br>
         <p>His weapon is a lighting bolt fashioned by the 3 Cyclops.</p> <br>

         <p>Poseidon son of Kronos and Rhea is the god of the Sea, Earthquakes, and Horses. </p> <br>
         <p>He is represented by symbols such as Trident, Fish, Dolphin, Horse, Bull.</p> <br>
         <p>His weapon is a Trident and was fashioned by the 3 Cyclops.</p> <br>
         <p>Poseidon is considered one of not the most bad-tempered, moody and greedy.</p> <br>
         <p>He was known to be vengeful when insulted.</p> <br>
         <p>An example of this is when Athens chose Athena over him and then they</p> <br>
         <p>began shipping Olives (the gift from Athena) around Greece obviously by</p> <br>
         <p>ship, which led to very rough waters and storms when sailing the sea. </p> <br>
