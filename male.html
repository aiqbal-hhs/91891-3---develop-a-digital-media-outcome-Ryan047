         <p>Zeus son of Kronos and Rhea, is the God of the Sky and King of the Gods of Mount Olympus.</p> <br>
         <p>When he was born his father planned to swallow him as he did his other children.</p> <br>
         <p>However Rhea hid newborn baby Zeus and gave Kronos a rock diguised as the baby to swallow.</p> <br>
         <p>When he was old enough he caused Kronos to vomit up his siblings and they vanquished their father.</p> <br>
         <p>He then split up creation with his brothers.</p> <br>
         <p>He claimed the sky and became King of Gods and Mount Olympus.</p> <br>
         <p>He is represented by symbols such as the Lightning bolt and the Eagle.</p> <br>
         <p>His weapon is a lighting bolt fashioned by the 3 Cyclops.</p> <br>

         <p>He is represented by symbols such as Trident, Fish, Dolphin, Horse, Bull.</p> <br>
         <p>His weapon is a Trident and was fashioned by the 3 Cyclops.</p> <br>
         <p>Poseidon is considered one of not the most bad-tempered, moody and greedy.</p> <br>
         <p>He was known to be vengeful when insulted.</p> <br>
         <p>An example of this is when Athens chose Athena over him and then they</p> <br>
         <p>began shipping Olives (the gift from Athena) around Greece obviously by</p> <br>
         <p>ship, which led to very rough waters and storms when sailing the sea. </p> <br>

        <p>Hephaestus is the god of fire, metalworking, masonry, forges and the art </p> <br>
        <p>of sculpture. Son of Hera was Hera's parthenogenous child as revenge on Zeus for </p>  <br>
        <p>Athena. However she did a terrible job and he came out deformed and munted and </p>  <br>
        <p>was cast off Mount Olympus by his mother because of his deformity Hephaestus</p>  <br>
        <p>gained revenge against Hera for rejecting him by making her a magical golden </p> <br>
        <p>throne, which, when she sat on it, did not allow her to stand up. The other gods</p> <br>
        <p>begged Hephaestus to return to Olympus to let her go, but he refused, saying </p> <br>
        <p>"I have no mother". At last,  Dionysus fetched him, intoxicated him with wine, and took</p> <br>
        <p> the subdued smith back to Olympus on the back of a mule  accompanied by revelers and brought him to heaven.</p> <br>

        <p>the Sun and light, poetry, and many more things. </p> <br>
        <p>Since Hera was annoyed that Zeus had cheated on her again she forbid Leto to give </p> <br>
        <p>birth on any land.  However Apollo informed his mother about a floating island named Delos </p> <br>
        <p>that had once been Asteria, Leto's own sister. Since it was neither a mainland nor an island,</p> <br>
        <p>Leto was readily welcomed there and gave birth to her children under a palm tree.</p> <br>
        <p>Apollo's birth fixed the floating Delos to the Earth.</p> <br>
        <p>His symbols are bow and arrows, the lyre the raven, branch of laurel, wreath, the kithara, </p> <br>
        <p>the plectrun, the sword, and palm trees.</p> <br>

        <p>Son of Zeus and Maia, the Pleiad.</p> <br>
        <p>Hermes functioned as the emissary and messenger of the gods. His attributes and symbols </p> <br>
        <p>include the herma, the rooster, the tortoise, satchel or pouch, and winged helmet </p> <br>
        <p>or simple petasos, as well as the palm tree, several kinds of fish, and incense.</p> <br>
        <p>His main symbol is the caduceus, a winged staff intertwined with two snakes copulating and carvings of the other gods.</p> <br>
        <p>Hermes plays the role of the psychopomp or "soul guide" â€” a conductor of souls into the afterlife.</p>
