         <p>Zeus son of Kronos and Rhea, is the God of the Sky and King of the Gods of Mount Olympus.</p> <br>
         <p>When he was born his father planned to swallow him as he did his other children.</p> <br>
         <p>However Rhea hid newborn baby Zeus and gave Kronos a rock diguised as the baby to swallow.</p> <br>
         <p>When he was old enough he caused Kronos to vomit up his siblings and they vanquished their father.</p> <br>
         <p>He then split up creation with his brothers.</p> <br>
         <p>He claimed the sky and became King of Gods and Mount Olympus.</p> <br>
         <p>He is represented by symbols such as the Lightning bolt and the Eagle.</p> <br>
         <p>His weapon is a lighting bolt fashioned by the 3 Cyclops.</p> <br>

         <p>Poseidon son of Kronos and Rhea is the god of the Sea, Earthquakes, and Horses. </p> <br>
         <p>He is represented by symbols such as Trident, Fish, Dolphin, Horse, Bull.</p> <br>
         <p>His weapon is a Trident and was fashioned by the 3 Cyclops.</p> <br>
         <p>Poseidon is considered one of not the most bad-tempered, moody and greedy.</p> <br>
         <p>He was known to be vengeful when insulted.</p> <br>
         <p>An example of this is when Athens chose Athena over him and then they</p> <br>
         <p>began shipping Olives (the gift from Athena) around Greece obviously by</p> <br>
         <p>ship, which led to very rough waters and storms when sailing the sea. </p> <br>

        <p>Son of Zeus and Hera, Ares is the god of war and courage.</p> <br>
        <p>Ares is a god of war, but also of destruction. Zeus tells Ares that his bloodlust makes him the most hated of the Olympians.  </p> <br>
        <p>He often represents the physical or violent and untamed aspect of war and is the personification </p> <br>
        <p>of sheer brutality and bloodlust, in contrast to his sister Athena.</p> <br>
        <p>Ares’ attributes were a helmet, shield, and sword or spear.</p> <br>
        <p>He often started fights regardless of consequences. </p> <br>
        <p>Ares had an affair with Aphrodite, wife of Hephaestus.</p> <br>
        <p>Who was married to Aphrodite by Zeus to prevent a war of gods fighting for her hand.</p>

        <p>Hephaestus is the god of fire, metalworking, masonry, forges and the art </p> <br>
        <p>of sculpture. Son of Hera was Hera's parthenogenous child as revenge on Zeus for </p>  <br>
        <p>Athena. However she did a terrible job and he came out deformed and munted and </p>  <br>
        <p>was cast off Mount Olympus by his mother because of his deformity Hephaestus</p>  <br>
        <p>gained revenge against Hera for rejecting him by making her a magical golden </p> <br>
        <p>throne, which, when she sat on it, did not allow her to stand up. The other gods</p> <br>
        <p>begged Hephaestus to return to Olympus to let her go, but he refused, saying </p> <br>
        <p>"I have no mother". At last,  Dionysus fetched him, intoxicated him with wine, and</p> <br>
        <p>took the subdued smith back to Olympus on the back of a mule  accompanied by revelers and brought him to heaven. </p> <br>

        <p>Apollo son of Zeus and Leto, twin brother of Artemis. </p> <br>
        <p>He is the god of archery, music and dance, truth and prophecy, healing and diseases, </p> <br>
        <p>the Sun and light, poetry, and many more things. </p> <br>
        <p>Since Hera was annoyed that Zeus had cheated on her again she forbid Leto to give </p> <br>
        <p>birth on any land.  However Apollo informed his mother about a floating island named Delos </p> <br>
        <p>that had once been Asteria, Leto's own sister. Since it was neither a mainland nor an island,</p> <br>
        <p>Leto was readily welcomed there and gave birth to her children under a palm tree.</p> <br>
        <p>Apollo's birth fixed the floating Delos to the Earth.</p> <br>
        <p>His symbols are bow and arrows, the lyre the raven, branch of laurel, wreath, the kithara, </p> <br>
        <p>the plectrun, the sword, and palm trees.</p> <br>

        <p>Dionysus is called "twice-born". Hera, queen of the gods, jealous because her</p> <br>
        <p>husband was playing around,(again) she punished the woman. In this case, Semele.</p> <br>
        <p>Zeus had visited Semele in human form but claimed to be a god. </p> <br>
        <p>Hera persuaded her that she needed more than his word that he</p> <br>
        <p> was divine. Zeus knew the sight of him in all his splendor would prove fatal, </p> <br>
        <p>but he had no choice, so he revealed himself. His lightning brightness killed Semele,</p> <br>
        <p>but first, Zeus took the unborn from her womb and sewed it inside his thigh.</p> <br>
        <p>There it gestated until it was time for the birth.</p> <br>

        <p>Son of Zeus and Maia, the Pleiad.</p> <br>
        <p>Hermes functioned as the emissary and messenger of the gods. His attributes and </p> <br>
        <p>symbols  include the herma, the rooster, the tortoise, satchel or pouch, and winged helmet or simple petasos, as well as the palm tree.</p> <br>
        <p>His main symbol is the caduceus, a winged staff intertwined with two snakes copulating </p> <br>
        <p>and carvings of the other gods. Hermes plays the role of the psychopomp or "soul guide" </p> <br>
        <p>— a conductor of souls into the afterlife. He is the most clever of the Olympian gods,</p> <br>
        <p>and ruled over wealth, good fortune, commerce, fertility, and thievery and because of his speed, </p> <br>
        <p>he was sometimes considered a god of winds.</p> <br>
